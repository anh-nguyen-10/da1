It's important to note that the findings of this study are not causal, meaning that researchers can't say for sure that watching TV causes unhealthy aging. But the researchers pointed out that sitting for long periods has been linked to reduced insulin sensitivity, increased inflammation, and reduced blood flow to the brain, while sitting in front of the TV specifically has been associated with unhealthy eating patterns, including overeating, which increases the risk of disease.
